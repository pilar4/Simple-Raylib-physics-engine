# Disclaimer
A significant portion of this project was developed with the assistance of AI language models. This should not be regarded as an issue, as the primary objective of the project is to gain practical experience in real-time physics simulation. At the outset, I had no prior experience in this domain (as noted in the README.md). Furthermore, the preparation of this documentation is intended as part of the learning process, serving to consolidate and deepen the understanding of the coding techniques applied. It's worth to add that one of the aims was to understand how github works as well as working non-solo (in this 
case a duo).
