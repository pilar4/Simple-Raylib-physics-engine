# PhysicsEngine
**Simple single-threaded 2D physics engine, developed from scratch using RayLib and C++.**  
This project is designed to help learn and explore the fundamentals of simulating physics.  
It also helps us learn GitHub usage and collaborative development.

### Features / Planned:
- [x] Calculating object physics using semi-implicit Euler integration
- [x] Calculating object physics using PBD (Verlet integration)
- [x] Working collision between both types of said objects
- [x] Working camera and HUD displaying information
- [x] Manipulating variables in real time (delta time, restitution, gravity)
- [x] Videos for showcasing

-------------------

### Videos:

Warm color circles (RED, ORANGE, GOLD, YELLOW, PINK) are calculated using Euler integration
Cold color circles (BLUE, DARKBLUE, SKYBLUE, PURPLE, DARKPURPLE) are calculated using PBD (Verlet integration)
