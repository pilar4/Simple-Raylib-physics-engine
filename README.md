# PhysicsEngine
**Simple single-threaded 2D physics engine, developed from scratch using RayLib and C++**  
**This project is designed to help learn and explore the fundamentals of simulating physics**
**As well as expanding our knowledge on using GitHub and collaborating in a team (in this case, a duo).**
### Planned:
- [x] Bouncing balls
- [x] Rigid bodies
- [x] Working camera
- [ ] Sand
- [ ] Water / other liquids
- [x] Gravity manipulation
- [ ] Gravity fields (black holes and such)
- [x] Time slow / stop
- [ ] Toolbar w/ toggle on/off
- [x] Some basic settings
- [ ] Explosions
